            <p> Consider it a great joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you experience various trials, because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.</p>
            <p> Are you kidding?! James wants them to consider it joy because they are being persecuted?! While that may feel insensitive, James is reminding them about how to the “Jesus way” of life. Jesus suffered and died because he had an eternal purpose in mind for all of us. If Jesus had to suffer, who are we to think that we are immune to experiencing circumstances that are less than ideal?</p>
            <p><strong> We don’t rejoice because of the trial, but because of what God can produce in us as we navigate through the trial. (vs. 4)</strong></p>
            <p>He wants to show us that just like Jesus, if we are going to go through it, might as well grow through it. What if the trial you are going through right now is the very thing God needs you to go through because He knows that on the other side of it all, you will be the best version of yourself? The best husband. The best wife. The best friend. The best parent. The best son. The best daughter. The best Christ follower.</p>
            <p><strong>My Prayer for You</strong></p>
            <p> Don't get stuck asking God,<span>“Why am I going through this difficult season?” </span>Instead let’s start to ask God, “How do you want me to go through this difficult season?” His answer may just be the very thing you need to experience the full depth of His love.</p>
